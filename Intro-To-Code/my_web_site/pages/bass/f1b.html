            <h2>Fender Player Precision Bass PF, Capri orange Overview</h2>
            <p>The Fender Player Precision Bass combines the unrivalled heritage of Fender with their constant thirst
                for innovation, to deliver a bass that's tailored for players who seek a little more out of their
                instrument. Stemming from Fender's esteemed Mexican factory, the Player P-Bass is as versatile as it is
                powerful. And it's all thanks to the Alnico 5 split single-coil that's fitted into the bridge position,
                unleashing a thunderous punch and supreme clarity with every note you play.</p>
            <p>But this is a bass that not only excels sonically. It's crafted for superb playability, too. An
                ultra-smooth maple neck interlocks with a dual-cutaway alder body for a lightweight feel and effortless
                finger movement. Not to mention the robust 4-saddle bridge, ensuring your bass is perfectly in tune
                every time you pick it up. Because this is an instrument that's embellished with all the hallmarks of
                Fender's hailed history. So empower your performance, and bring your music to life with the bass that
                started it all...</p>
